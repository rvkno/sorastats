# SoraStats Platform Comparison: Sora vs Luma vs Runway

You have $50 to spend on AI video generation this month. Do you choose Sora, Luma, or Runway?

This isn't a hypothetical. Thousands of creators face this decision daily, and the wrong choice costs more than money—it costs time learning tools that don't fit your workflow, credits wasted on subpar outputs, and opportunities missed while competitors publish with the right platform.

SoraStats data tracking 28.5 million AI-generated videos reveals clear performance differences between the three leading platforms. Sora dominates social virality (15.1M views on top videos), Luma excels at rapid iteration (5-second generation times), and Runway leads in precise creative control (frame-by-frame editing). This guide provides the objective comparison you need to invest wisely.

## The AI Video Generation Landscape

The AI video generation market reached a tipping point in late 2025. What was experimental technology six months ago now powers millions of daily content creation workflows.

**Current market leaders:**

* **Sora** (OpenAI): Launched publicly December 2024, reached 4.56M creators by November 2025
* **Luma Dream Machine**: Known for speed and simplicity, popular with rapid-iteration creators
* **Runway Gen-3**: Professional-grade tools, favored by filmmakers and high-end content producers

Each serves different creator needs. Sora built a social ecosystem (Sora.com) where videos live natively and gain distribution. Luma positioned itself as the "fast food" option—quick, consistent, accessible. Runway targets professionals willing to trade speed for granular control.
